## What is Saturday Hack Night?

Saturday Hack Night is not just your regular hackathon. Here, we will be building solutions / applications via API integration.
* The needed resource, the respective API and documentation will be shared with you once you register. And remember this is a one time registration! If you have registered once, you need not have to repeat it again for the next.
* API for this week is MapBox API.
